The original GEMF implementation in C was developed by Futing Fan, [Copyright (c) 2016](LICENSE). It has since been updated [Niema Moshiri](https://niema.net/). This version further modified to reproduce Pekar et al.'22.

## Installation
The `GEMF` tool is written in C and has no dependencies beyond a modern C++ compiler (and `make` for convenience). You can simply download the latest release tarball (or clone the repo) and compile with `make`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nizzaneela/GEMF.git
cd GEMF
make
sudo mv GEMF /usr/local/bin/ # optional step to install globally
```
